# About the workshop

We will be taking a look at the basic concepts of data pipelines as well as practical use cases using Python and libraries like pandas, matplotlib, and tensorflow.

## About you:
- Some experience using the command line
- Intermediate Python knowledge / use
- Be able to apply what we learn and adopt to your use cases
- Interested in data and systems
- Aspring or current data engineering
- Some knowledge about systems and databases (enough to be dangerous)

## Our focus for the day
- Greater understanding on how to apply data pipelines using the Python and libraries in the Python scientific ecosystem
- Focus on concepts (rather than complex implementations)
- Practical knowledge application
- Create the building blocks needed for your day-to-day work

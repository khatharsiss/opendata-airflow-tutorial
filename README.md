This repo contains a tutorial on Airflow using census data and the Chicago taxi dataset. 

For a detailed overview of the requirements, setup and contents visit the docs URL: <https://opendata-airflow-tutorial.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>


_Note_: this is still much in progress and I plan to add more pipelines, use cases and a how-to deploy to Azure Kubernetes services.
